class RGdsfmt(RPackage):
    """This package provides a high-level R interface to CoreArray Genomic
       Data Structure (GDS) data files, which are portable across platforms
       with hierarchical structure to store multiple scalable array-oriented
       data sets with metadata information. It is suited for large-scale
       datasets, especially for data which are much larger than the available
       random-access memory. The gdsfmt package offers the efficient
       operations specifically designed for integers of less than 8 bits,
       since a diploid genotype, like single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP),
       usually occupies fewer bits than a byte. Data compression and
       decompression are available with relatively efficient random access.
       It is also allowed to read a GDS file in parallel with multiple R
       processes supported by the package parallel."""
