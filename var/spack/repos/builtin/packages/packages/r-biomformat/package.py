class RBiomformat(RPackage):
    """This is an R package for interfacing with the BIOM format. This
    package includes basic tools for reading biom-format files, accessing
    and subsetting data tables from a biom object (which is more complex
    than a single table), as well as limited support for writing a
    biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design of this API is
    intended to match the python API and other tools included with the
    biom-format project, but with a decidedly "R flavor" that should be
    familiar to R users. This includes S4 classes and methods, as well
    as extensions of common core functions/methods."""
